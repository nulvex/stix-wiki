title: Cyber-observable Objects
---

STIX cyber observables are raw, factual data points or measurable events from within a network or system that can be used to describe cyber threat information. These observables are the fundamental "facts" about a cyber incident or environment, such as an IP address, file hash, or domain name, which can be used as building blocks to create more complex threat intelligence, like indicators, patterns, and relationships.
