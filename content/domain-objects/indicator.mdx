Indicators contain a pattern that can be used to detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity. For example, an Indicator may be used to represent a set of malicious domains and use the STIX Patterning Language (see section 9) to specify these domains.

The Indicator SDO contains a simple textual description, the Kill Chain Phases that it detects behavior in, a time window for when the Indicator is valid or useful, and a required pattern property to capture a structured detection pattern. Conforming STIX implementations MUST support the STIX Patterning Language as defined in section 9.

Relationships from the Indicator can describe the malicious or suspicious behavior that it directly detects (Malware, Tool, and Attack Pattern). In addition, it may also imply the presence of a Campaigns, Intrusion Sets, and Threat Actors, etc.

## Properties
<PropertiesOverview type='indicator' />
<PropertyDefinitions type='indicator' />

## Relationships
These are the relationships explicitly defined between the Indicator object and other STIX Objects. The first section lists the embedded relationships by property name along with their corresponding target. The rest of the table identifies the relationships that can be made from this object type to another object type by way of the Relationship object. The reverse relationships section illustrates the relationships targeting this object type from another object type. They are included here for convenience. For their definitions, please see the "Source" object.

Relationships are not restricted to those listed below. Relationships can be created between any objects using the related-to relationship type or, as with open vocabularies, user-defined names.
