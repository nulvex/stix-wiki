Malware Analysis captures the metadata and results of a particular static or dynamic analysis performed on a malware instance or family. One of result or analysis_sco_refs properties MUST be provided.

## Properties
<PropertiesOverview type='malware-analysis' />
<PropertyDefinitions type='malware-analysis' />

## Relationships
These are the relationships explicitly defined between the Malware Analysis object and other STIX Objects. The first section lists the embedded relationships by property name along with their corresponding target. The rest of the table identifies the relationships that can be made from this object type to another object type by way of the Relationship object. The reverse relationships section illustrates the relationships targeting this object type from another object type. They are included here for convenience. For their definitions, please see the "Source" object.

Relationships are not restricted to those listed below. Relationships can be created between any objects using the related-to relationship type or, as with open vocabularies, user-defined names.
