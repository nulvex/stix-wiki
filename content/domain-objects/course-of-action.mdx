<Callout>
The Course of Action object in STIX 2.1 is a stub. It is included to support basic use cases (such as sharing prose courses of action) but does not support the ability to represent automated courses of action or contain properties to represent metadata about courses of action. Future STIX 2 releases will expand it to include these capabilities.

A Course of Action is an action taken either to prevent an attack or to respond to an attack that is in progress. It may describe technical, automatable responses (applying patches, reconfiguring firewalls) but can also describe higher level actions like employee training or policy changes. For example, a course of action to mitigate a vulnerability could describe applying the patch that fixes it.

The Course of Action SDO contains a textual description of the action; a reserved <b>action</b> property also serves as a placeholder for future inclusion of machine automatable courses of action.

## Properties
<PropertiesOverview type='course-of-action' />
<PropertyDefinitions type='course-of-action' />

## Relationships
These are the relationships explicitly defined between the Course of Action object and other STIX Objects. The first section lists the embedded relationships by property name along with their corresponding target. The rest of the table identifies the relationships that can be made from this object type to another object type by way of the Relationship object. The reverse relationships section illustrates the relationships targeting this object type from another object type. They are included here for convenience. For their definitions, please see the "Source" object.

Relationships are not restricted to those listed below. Relationships can be created between any objects using the related-to relationship type or, as with open vocabularies, user-defined names.
