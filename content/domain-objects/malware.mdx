Malware is a type of TTP that represents malicious code. It generally refers to a program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly. The intent is to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim's data, applications, or operating system (OS) or otherwise annoy or disrupt the victim.

The Malware SDO characterizes, identifies, and categorizes malware instances and families from data that may be derived from analysis. This SDO captures detailed information about how the malware works and what it does. This SDO captures contextual data relevant to sharing Malware data without requiring the full analysis provided by the Malware Analysis SDO.

The Indicator SDO provides intelligence producers with the ability to define, using the STIX Pattern Grammar in a standard way to identify and detect behaviors associated with malicious activities. Although the Malware SDO provides vital intelligence on a specific instance or malware family, it does not provide a standard grammar that the Indicator SDO provides to identify those properties in security detection systems designed to process the STIX Pattern grammar. We strongly encourage the use of STIX Indicators for the detection of actual malware, due to its use of the STIX Patterning language and the clear semantics that it provides.

To minimize the risk of a consumer compromising their system in parsing malware samples, producers SHOULD consider sharing defanged content (archive and password-protected samples) instead of raw, base64-encoded malware samples.

## Properties
<PropertiesOverview type='malware' />
<PropertyDefinitions type='malware' />

## Relationships
These are the relationships explicitly defined between the Malware object and other STIX Objects. The first section lists the embedded relationships by property name along with their corresponding target. The rest of the table identifies the relationships that can be made from this object type to another object type by way of the Relationship object. The reverse relationships section illustrates the relationships targeting this object type from another object type. They are included here for convenience. For their definitions, please see the "Source" object.

Relationships are not restricted to those listed below. Relationships can be created between any objects using the related-to relationship type or, as with open vocabularies, user-defined names.
