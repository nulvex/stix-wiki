title: Bundle Object
---

A Bundle is a collection of arbitrary STIX Objects grouped together in a single container. A Bundle does not have any semantic meaning and the objects contained within the Bundle are not considered related by virtue of being in the same Bundle.

A STIX Bundle Object is not a STIX Object but makes use of the type and id Common Properties. A Bundle is transient, and implementations SHOULD NOT assume that other implementations will treat it as a persistent object or keep any custom properties found on the bundle itself.

The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON Object type [RFC8259] when representing bundle.
